		<div class="article-title">"One morning he played from memory fourteen Preludes and Fugues of Bach's, and when I expressed my joyful admiration at this unparalleled performance, he replied: "Cela ne s'oublie jamais," and smiling sadly he continued: "Depuis un an je n'ai pas étudié un quart d'heure de suite, je n'ai pas de force, pas d'energie." - Friederike Streicher</div>

		<div class="article-title">"When I played with him the study in C major, the first of those he dedicated to Liszt, he bade me practice it in the mornings very slowly. "Cette étude vous fera du bien," he said. "Si vous l'étudiez comme je l'entends, cela élargit la main, et cela vous donne des gammes d'accords, comme les coups d'archet." - Friederike Streicher</div>

		<div class="article-title">"Chopin played several recitals and made a bit of money around the city, but he was also unwell again, spitting blood and suffering from insomnia. As the social season ended, the aristroacy headed for their homes in the country, and Chopin had little choice but to go with Striling to her properties in Scotland." - Victor Lederer</div>

		<div class="article-title">"Painting until dinner," Chopin reported in a letter to his friend Albert Grzymala that he sat with the gentlemen, "watching them talk and listening to them drink." As Chopin spoke no English, his hosts politely spoke their rudimentary French, but Chopin was terribly bored." - Victor Lederer</div>

		<div class="article-title">"I made the railway journey from London to Edinburgh by the Express train, 407 miles in twelve hours, and it may have been a little too much for me. Anyhow, it's of no consequence. I am here to rest after the London season and keep quiet till the 28th of this month, when I am due in Manchester." - F. Chopin</div>

		<div id="smallertext" class="article-title">"Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin (1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polish-French composer and virtuoso pianist. He is considered one of the greatest Romantic piano composers. Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. A famous child prodigy, he grew up in Warsaw where he completed his music education and composed many of his mature works before leaving Poland in 1830 at age 20, shortly before the November 1830 Uprising." - Wikipedia
