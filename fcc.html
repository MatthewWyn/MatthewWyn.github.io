  	<i>Matthew Wyn Davies</i> -Jan 28, 2018.
    <h2 class="d-none d-sm-block">I started from complete scratch with web dev in Novemer, 2017. These are some things I learnt by finally building the FreeCodeCamp tribute site.</h2>      
    <p>After countless lessons and tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, CodeCademy, Udemy, YouTube, SitePoint, Medium, Lynda... I finally got round to doing the first FreeCodeCamp project of building a tribute site! But in these short few months I've also discovered some incredible teachers (I've narrowed it down to my favourite two) on Udemy and YouTube. Although there are many good resources online I still felt like I needed a structure ("To know what I needed to know") and the teacher I put my trust into was <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Colt Steele</a>. And more recently <a href="https://www.udemy.com/web-design-for-beginners-real-world-coding-in-html-css/">Brad Schiff</a>. These guys are incredible teachers, there is something they just GET about approaching every concept from the eyes of a beginner. They use repetition of learning material in a really creative way (by building several mini-projects that reuse the same things you've been learning. They talk slowly, they don't waffle and they keep you engaged).     </p>

  <h5>But how do you know if you're getting anywhere?</h5>

    <a href="https://medium.com/@bonham000/why-i-built-free-code-camps-front-end-projects-twice-c3dadfd03b6a">Sean Smith (posting on Medium)</a> has some great advice on making you realise that you should hone in on what <em>works for you</em>. (I know that phrase is thrown around like an old clich√©!). <br>
    <p>"To improve your learning process you have to become very cognizant of what works for you, how you learn effectively, and how to locate the best resources for your learning style. Then, you can begin to optimize your learning approach based on these observations. For example, <b>I knew that I benefited from watching video tutorials and coding alongside them.</b>"</p>

<h5>The things I learnt making the <b>tribute site</b> (In other words: The things that still hadn't sunk in by only watching tutorials and code-alongs):</h5>
<div style="padding: 20px;" class="card">
  <div class="card-block">
    <ul>
    	<li>How to use the <b>"background-size: cover"</b> so that the header image is cropped and cut to fit, but if it has plenty of room then it shows more of the image. This gives a nice responsive and "zoomy" feel to the site.</li>
    	<li>How to use the CSS grid (On YouTube I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7tLPhnA06w&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itC4TxYMzFCfveyutyPOCY">Net Ninja</a>'s excellent and free CSS Grid course)</li>
    	<li>I discovered that a CSS framework link rel has to come before your stylesheet in the HTML header</li>
    	<li>I learnt how to fix a problem where I couldn't display the hover pop-up text on the gallery images without cutting off the text... <b>box-sizing: border-box;</b> solved it! (This was from looking at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_transparent.asp">W3Schools </a>examples, which I recommend playing with. I even used it to double check the Bootstrap jumbotron code for this page!) </li>
    	<li>I learnt that CSS Grid is preffered by many web developers over Flexbox even though CSS Grid is relatively new. But also, any developers say that CSS Grid is good for some things and Flexbox is good for other things. I am learning them both.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Some final thoughts</h4>
    <p>I think learning is a "mess". You learn 5 things here, 1 thing there. Then it seems like you learn nothing at all for 3 days straight. Then you suddenly surprise yourself. I don't think this will really change as I continue studying. However, courses are still very useful because they give you structure and show you the path of things that you need to be working on, even if you end up disliking how one teacher teaches Flexbox (you can always find another tutorial).
